# Piano Web Page

This project is a simple piano web page built using HTML and CSS. It includes both white and black keys and is styled to look like a physical piano. It also includes the freeCodeCamp logo at the top. The piano's appearance adapts to different screen sizes thanks to responsive design.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and open the HTML file in your browser.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the piano. Each key of the piano is represented by a `<div>` with the class `key`. Black keys additionally have the class `black--key`.

- `styles.css`: Contains all the styling for the piano. This includes the overall structure of the piano, the look of the keys, and the media queries for responsive design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The piano adjusts its size depending on the size of the viewport to provide an optimal viewing experience on different devices.

- **Key Highlights**: Each key of the piano is individually styled. White keys have a white background, while black keys have a darker color.

- **freeCodeCamp Logo**: The freeCodeCamp logo is included at the top of the piano.
